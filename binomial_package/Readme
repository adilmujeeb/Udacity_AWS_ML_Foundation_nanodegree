This is an updated sample python package.
To build this package, go to the directory containing distribution directory and setup.py file.
pip3 install . 
OR
pip install .

If you change the code in the distributions folder after pip installing the package, you'll need 
to run the following:

pip install --upgrade 

Now you can use the distributions package by entering the following on python interpreter:

>>> from distributions import Gaussian
>>> g = Gaussian(10,2)
>>> g.mean
10
>>> g.stdev
2
